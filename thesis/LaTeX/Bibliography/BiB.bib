	abstract = {Now in its third edition, the classic book on game design has been completely revised to include the latest developments in the game industry. Readers will learn all the fundamentals of concept development, gameplay design, core mechanics, user interfaces, storytelling, and balancing. Theyll be introduced to designing for mobile devices and touch screens, as well as for the Kinect and motion-capture gameplay. Theyll learn how indie developers are pushing the envelope and how new business models such as free-to-play are influencing design. In an easy-to-follow approach, Adams offers a first-hand look into the process of designing a game, from initial concept to final tuning. This in-depth resource also comes with engaging end-of-chapter exercises, design worksheets, and case studies.}

In this paper, the application of Markov analysis in system safety assessment is studied, and the common method of Markov analysis for system safety assessment is given. A failure state of flight control system is modeled and analyzed by Markov analysis and fault tree analysis respectively, and the results show that Markov method has a higher accuracy of quantitative analysis of the sequence related events. This method also overcomes the shortcomings of the static analysis features of the fault tree analysis.}

	abstract = {Game-based learning and 21st century skills have been gaining an enormous amount of attention from researchers and practitioners. Given numerous studies support the positive effects of games on learning, a growing number of researchers are committed to developing educational games to promote students’ 21st century skill development in schools. However, little is known regarding how games may influence student acquisition of 21st century skills. This paper examines the most recent literature in regard to game-based learning and identified 29 studies which targeted 21st century skills as outcomes. The range of game genres and game design elements as well as learning theories used in these studies are discussed, together with the range of indicators, measures and outcomes for impacts on 21st century skills. The findings suggest that a game-based learning approach might be effective in facilitating students’ 21st century skill development. The paper also provides valuable insights for researchers, game designers, and educators in issues related to educational game design and implementation in general.}

	abstract = {Gamification, the application of game elements to non-game settings, continues to grow in popularity as a method to increase student engagement in the classroom. We tested students across two courses, measuring their motivation, social comparison, effort, satisfaction, learner empowerment, and academic performance at four points during a 16-week semester. One course received a gamified curriculum, featuring a leaderboard and badges, whereas the other course received the same curriculum without the gamified elements. Our results found that students in the gamified course showed less motivation, satisfaction, and empowerment over time than those in the non-gamified class. The effect of course type on students' final exam scores was mediated by students' levels of intrinsic motivation, with students in the gamified course showing less motivation and lower final exam scores than the non-gamified class. This suggests that some care should be taken when applying certain gamification mechanics to educational settings.}

	abstract = { This article introduces an original model-based design methodology addressing a high-performance aircraft design challenge: conflicting performance requirements. The case study of the Global 7500 elevator actuation system also provides in-depth insight into the complex design process of today’s fly-by-wire flight control systems. The methodology presented here redefines the aircraft manufacturer’s involvement in the design process of the systems, implementing analysis and iteration capabilities early in system development. To this end, it introduces a novel modeling approach for analyzing loaded rate requirements by simulating closed-loop performance with a generic nonlinear second-order state filter, including the main performance limitations without requiring a preliminary design definition. In this way, it provides means to mature the system requirements and addresses requirement conflicts upfront. Then, a simulation-based preliminary sizing and performance assessment validates the candidate design concept. It also secures the preliminary design phase by implementing advanced design uncertainties and involving interfacing systems and disciplines early in the process. The redefined methodology identified directly that the problem’s root cause was a conflict between stability and control and flutter protection requirements. It also indicated that the first sizing driver is the response time required under a specific failure case. These findings lead to an optimal elevator actuator design compliant with matured performance requirements. Thus, the methodology resolved a design challenge blocking the Global 7500 aircraft development and prevented redesign occurrences later during the detailed design phase. In this way, it directly contributed to the successful development of the Global 7500 and its optimal operational performance. This methodology applies to future aircraft design challenges, and the technical insight provides valuable lessons learned for high-performance T-tail business jets. }

We state conditions under which the complexity for approximate convergence is polynomial in n, the number of variables, approximate convergence takes time O(n log n) as n → ∞ if the target field satisfies certain spatial mixing conditions. Otherwise, if the field has a potential with finite interaction range independent of n, the complexity is exponential in ny, with $y < 1$, which is still more favourable than enumerating all the states. When the interaction range grows with n, the algorithms can converge exponentially in n. Analogous results are provided for an expectation approximated by an average along the chain.},
