\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}


Therefore, a game concept needs to be designed, a game engine needs to be developed and levels need to be created.

% establish your territory (say what the topic is about)
From pilot commands that need to executed on the aircraft control surfaces to entertainment systems such:
Modern aircraft use multiple different, partly interconnected systems in order to guarantee a safe flight and make it
as pleasant as possible for the passengers.
Hardware and software components used in these systems have a probability of failure that is determined by the quality of the materials
and the production process including different testing scenarios. \todo{add source}

% establish a niche (show why there needs to be further research on your topic)
Due to the complexity of relations between different systems and high time constants required, this can be difficult
to understand especially for children and adults with no or little knowledge in this area of competence.
The goal of this thesis is to develop a game to present the formerly mentioned problems in an easily
accessible way.
% introduce the current research (make hypotheses; state the research questions)
