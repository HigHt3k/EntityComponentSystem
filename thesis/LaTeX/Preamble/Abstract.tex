% GOAL
Aircraft system architectures need to fulfill a minimum required safety constant in order to pass the certification process.
This masterâ€™s thesis aims to implement a program to present the safety requirements of the rather complex system architectures
of aircraft to people with none or low knowledge in this area of competence.
\\ \\
% METHODS
The program was implemented as a game with a background simulation in the programming language \textit{JAVA}.
A game concept was created with the help of specified game design process rules.
A game engine was developed to handle different features of games in general and the defined game mechanics were implemented.
\\ \\
% RESULTS
The final implementation is a puzzle-like game, where the user interacts with a puzzle board to design a system architecture,
which is then simulated in order to calculate the safety factors.
\\ \\
% DISCUSSION
In conclusion, the complexity of the subject of aircraft system architecture and safety factors is represented in a more simple
game approach, which is easier to grasp for layman.
