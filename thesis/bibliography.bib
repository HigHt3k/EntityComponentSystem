    abstract = {Now in its third edition, the classic book on game design has been completely revised to include the latest developments in the game industry. Readers will learn all the fundamentals of concept development, gameplay design, core mechanics, user interfaces, storytelling, and balancing. Theyll be introduced to designing for mobile devices and touch screens, as well as for the Kinect and motion-capture gameplay. Theyll learn how indie developers are pushing the envelope and how new business models such as free-to-play are influencing design. In an easy-to-follow approach, Adams offers a first-hand look into the process of designing a game, from initial concept to final tuning. This in-depth resource also comes with engaging end-of-chapter exercises, design worksheets, and case studies.}

    abstract = {Safety analysis is an important method of compliance demonstration for airworthiness regulation. In this paper, the application of Markov analysis in system safety assessment is studied, and the common method of Markov analysis for system safety assessment is given. A failure state of flight control system is modeled and analyzed by Markov analysis and fault tree analysis respectively, and the results show that Markov method has a higher accuracy of quantitative analysis of the sequence related events. This method also overcomes the shortcomings of the static analysis features of the fault tree analysis.}
