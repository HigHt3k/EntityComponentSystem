\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
A major challenge in aircraft system design are the safety requirements in order to operate an aircraft.
However, due to the complexity of relations between different systems and high time constants required, this can be difficult
to understand especially for children and adults with no or little knowledge in this area of competence.
The goal of this thesis is to develop a game to present the formerly mentioned problems in an easily
accessible way.
Therefore, a game concept needs to be designed, a game engine needs to be developed and levels need to be created.
