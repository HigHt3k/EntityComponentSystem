    <string id="1001">Tutorial 1: Connecting Cables</string>
    <string id="1002">Welcome to the game. In this tutorial series you are going to learn all the basics you need to start implementing your own systems.</string>
    <string id="10021">You are presented a game field where components need to be connected by using cables.</string>
    <string id="10022">Click a cable from the bottom panel and drag it between the components.</string>
    <string id="10023">If correctly connected, the component will now light up green.</string>
    <string id="1003">Tutorial 2: Connecting Cables</string>
    <string id="1004">You can also place cables around corners. Try to connect the components by using the red cable and rotating the in- and output of the cable using the right and middle mouse buttons. Advice: the input ports of the actuator component are located at the left side of the component.</string>
    <string id="1005">Tutorial 3: Connecting Cables</string>
    <string id="1006">It is also possible to connect different components to a single other component. Try using the red and blue cables to connect both sensors to the computer. You can switch the cable color that is being rotated by using the keyboard buttons 1-4. Advice: 1: red, 2: blue, 3: green, 4: yellow</string>
    <string id="1007">Tutorial 4: Placing Components</string>
    <string id="1008">Not only cables can be used to build or enhance your systems - you can also use new components! Try to replicate the previous levels' layout by using the 2 computers and connect all the components.</string>
    <string id="1009">Tutorial 5: Removing and Replacing</string>
    <string id="1010">By accident, someone placed a sensor component instead of a computer component. Remove the wrong component by using the right mouse button or directly replace it by using the correct component on the same tile. Connect all the components again.</string>
